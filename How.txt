For Writing:
So for each node, starting at root:
If leaf-node: Output 1-bit + N-bit character/byte
If not leaf-node, output 0-bit. Then encode both child nodes (left first then right) the same way
To read, do this:

For Reading :
If 1, then read N-bit character/byte, return new node around it with no children
If bit was 0, decode left and right child-nodes the same way, and return new node around them with those children, but no value
